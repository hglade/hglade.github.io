# Support / Donations

### Voluntary support (donations)
If you'd like to support the development and maintenance of my open-source projects, you can send a donation.

**Please note:**
- Donations are **voluntary payments** to support the author and the project.
- **No goods or services are provided in exchange.**
- **No support level, delivery timeline, or feature implementation is guaranteed.**
- The project may change, pause, or be discontinued at any time.

This is **not** a charitable donation for tax-deduction purposes.

### Ways to support

- [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/cleverets)

### Refunds
Refunds and disputes are governed by the payment platform’s policies. If a payment was made by mistake, contact me and I’ll try to help within what the platform allows.
